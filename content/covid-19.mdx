The following notebook contains an [[exploration]] I did last summer on Covid-19. It's also available on [Github](https://github.com/m-arti/covid-19).

So the notebook will load faster, all sections are collapsed and interactivity is disabled. You can open/close a section by clicking the guillemet `»` — or double-clicking the downward arrow `↧` — adjacent to it, and enable interactivity (dynamic behaviour) by clicking the button on the bottom right corner.
