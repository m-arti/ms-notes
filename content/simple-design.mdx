## Laws of simplicity
---

By [John Maeda](http://lawsofsimplicity.com).

1. **Reduce.** The simplest way to achieve simplicity is through thoughtful reduction.

2. **Organize.** Organization makes a system of many appear fewer.

3. **Time.** Savings in time feel like simplicity.

4. **Learn.** Knowledge makes everything simpler.

5. **Differences.** Simplicity and complexity need each other.

6. **Context.** What lies in the periphery of simplicity is definitely not peripheral.

7. **Emotion.** More emotions are better than less.

8. **Trust.** In simplicity we trust.

9. **Failure.** Some things can never be made simple.

10. **The one.** Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.
