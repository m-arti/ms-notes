## Atlas of the Difficult World, XIII (Dedications)
---

*From [An Atlas of the Difficult World](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1014839412)*.

I know you are reading this poem <br/>
late, before leaving your office <br/>
of the one intense yellow lamp-spot and the darkening window <br/>
in the lassitude of a building faded to quiet <br/>
long after rush-hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you are reading this poem <br/>
standing up in a bookstore far from the ocean <br/>
on a gray day of early spring, faint flakes driven <br/>
across the plains' enormous spaces around you. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem <br/>
in a room where too much has happened for you to bear <br/>
where the bedclothes lie in stagnant coils on the bed <br/>
and the open valise speaks of flight <br/>
but you cannot leave yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you are reading this poem <br/>
as the underground train loses momentum and before running <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the stairs <br/>
toward a new kind of love <br/>
your life has never allowed. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem by the light <br/>
of the television screen where soundless images jerk and slide <br/>
while you wait for the newscast from the *intifada*. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem in a waiting-room <br/>
of eyes met and unmeeting, of identity with strangers. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem by fluorescent light <br/>
in the boredom and fatigue of the young who are counted out, <br/>
count themselves out, at too early an age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know <br/>
you are reading this poem through your failing sight, the thick <br/>
lens enlarging these letters beyond all meaning yet you read on <br/>
because even the alphabet is precious. <br/><br/>

I know you are reading this poem as you pace beside the stove <br/>
warming milk, a crying child on your shoulder, a book in your hand <br/>
because life is short and you too are thirsty. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem which is not in your language <br/>
guessing at some words while others keep you reading <br/>
and I want to know which words they are. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem listening for something, torn <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between bitterness and hope <br/>
turning back once again to the task you cannot refuse. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem because there is nothing <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else left to read <br/>
there where you have landed, stripped as you are.

## Cartographies of [[Silence]]
---

*From [The Dream of a Common Language: Poems
1974–1977](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/942544391)*.

<div><b>1.</b></div>

A conversation begins <br/>
with a lie. And each <br/>

speaker of the so-called common language feels <br/>
the ice-floe split, the drift apart <br/>

as if powerless, as if up against <br/>
a force of nature <br/>

A poem can begin <br/>
with a lie. And be torn up. <br/>

A conversation has other laws <br/>
recharges itself with its own <br/>

false energy. Cannot be torn <br/>
up. Infiltrates our blood. Repeats itself. <br/>

Inscribes with its unreturning stylus <br/>
the isolation it denies. <br/>

<div><b>2.</b></div>

The classical music station <br/>
playing hour upon hour in the apartment <br/>

the picking up and picking up <br/>
and again picking up the telephone <br/>

the syllables uttering <br/>
the old script over and over <br/>

The loneliness of the liar <br/>
living in the formal network of the lie <br/>

twisting the dials to drown the terror <br/>
beneath the unsaid word <br/>

<div><b>3.</b></div>

The technology of science <br/>
The rituals, the etiquette <br/>

the blurring of terms <br/>
silence not absence <br/>

of words or music or even <br/>
raw sounds <br/>

Silence can be a plan <br/>
rigorously executed <br/>

the blueprint to a life <br/>

It is a presence <br/>
it has a history &emsp;&emsp; a form <br/>

Do not confuse it <br/>
with any kind of absence <br/>

<div><b>4.</b></div>

How calm, how inoffensive these words <br/>
begin to seem to me <br/>

though begun in grief and anger <br/>
Can I break through this film of the abstract <br/>

without wounding myself or you <br/>
there is enough pain here <br/>

This is why the classical or the jazz music station plays? <br/>
to give a ground of meaning to our pain? <br/>


<div><b>5.</b></div>

The silence that strips bare: <br/>
In Dreyer’s *Passion of Joan* <br/>

Falconetti’s face, hair shorn, a great geography <br/>
mutely surveyed by the camera <br/>

If there were a poetry where this could happen <br/>
not as blank spaces or as words <br/>

stretched like skin over meanings <br/>
but as silence falls at the end <br/>

of a night through which two people <br/>
have talked till dawn <br/>

<div><b>6.</b></div>

The scream <br/>
of an illegitimate voice <br/>

It has ceased to hear itself, therefore <br/>
it asks itself <br/>

How do I exist? <br/>

This was the silence I wanted to break in you <br/>
I had questions but you would not answer <br/>

I had answers but you could not use them <br/>
This is useless to you and perhaps to others <br/>

<div><b>7.</b></div>

It was an old theme even for me: <br/>
Language cannot do everything– <br/>

chalk it on the walls where the dead poets <br/>
lie in their mausoleums <br/>

If at the will of the poet the poem <br/>
could turn into a thing <br/>

a granite flank laid bare, a lifted head <br/>
alight with dew <br/>

It if could simply look you in the face <br/>
with naked eyeballs, not letting you turn <br/>

till you, and I who long to make this thing, <br/>
were finally clarified together in its stare <br/>

<div><b>8.</b></div>

No. Let me have this dust, <br/>
these pale clouds dourly lingering, these words <br/>

moving with ferocious accuracy <br/>
like the blind child’s fingers <br/>

or the newborn infant’s mouth <br/>
violent with hunger <br/>

No one can give me, I have long ago <br/>
taken this method <br/>

whether of bran pouring from the loose-woven sack <br/>
or of the bunsen-flame turned low and blue <br/>

If from time to time I envy <br/>
the pure annunciations to the eye <br/>

the *visio beatifica* <br/>
if from time to time I long to turn <br/>

like the Eleusinian hierophant <br/>
holding up a simple ear of grain <br/>

for the return to the concrete and everlasting world <br/>
what in fact I keep choosing <br/>

are these words, these whispers, these conversations <br/>
from which time after time the truth breaks moist and green <br/>

## Diving into the Wreck
---

*From [Diving into the Wreck - Poems 1971-1972.](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1023182819)*

First having read the book of myths, <br/>
and loaded the camera, <br/>
and checked the edge of the knife-blade, <br/>
I put on <br/>
the body-armor of black rubber <br/>
the absurd flippers <br/>
the grave and awkward mask. <br/>
I am having to do this <br/>
not like Cousteau with his <br/>
assiduous team <br/>
aboard the sun-flooded schooner <br/>
but here alone.

There is a ladder. <br/>
The ladder is always there <br/>
hanging innocently <br/>
close to the side of the schooner. <br/>
We know what it is for, <br/>
we who have used it. <br/>
Otherwise <br/>
it is a piece of maritime floss <br/>
some sundry equipment. <br/>

I go down. <br/>
Rung after rung and still <br/>
the oxygen immerses me <br/>
the blue light <br/>
the clear atoms <br/>
of our human air. <br/>
I go down. <br/>
My flippers cripple me, <br/>
I crawl like an insect down the ladder <br/>
and there is no one <br/>
to tell me when the ocean <br/>
will begin. <br/>

First the air is blue and then <br/>
it is bluer and then green and then <br/>
black I am blacking out and yet <br/>
my mask is powerful <br/>
it pumps my blood with power <br/>
the sea is another story <br/>
the sea is not a question of power <br/>
I have to learn alone <br/>
to turn my body without force <br/>
in the deep element. <br/>

And now: it is easy to forget <br/>
what I came for <br/>
among so many who have always <br/>
lived here <br/>
swaying their crenellated fans <br/>
between the reefs <br/>
and besides <br/>
you breathe differently down here. <br/>

I came to explore the wreck. <br/>
The words are purposes. <br/>
The words are maps. <br/>
I came to see the damage that was done <br/>
and the treasures that prevail. <br/>
I stroke the beam of my lamp <br/>
slowly along the flank <br/>
of something more permanent <br/>
than fish or weed <br/>

the thing I came for: <br/>
the wreck and not the story of the wreck <br/>
the thing itself and not the myth <br/>
the drowned face always staring <br/>
toward the sun <br/>
the evidence of damage <br/>
worn by salt and sway into this threadbare beauty <br/>
the ribs of the disaster <br/>
curving their assertion <br/>
among the tentative haunters. <br/>

This is the place. <br/>
And I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair <br/>
streams black, the merman in his armored body. <br/>
We circle silently <br/>
about the wreck <br/>
we dive into the hold. <br/>
I am she: I am he <br/>

whose drowned face sleeps with open eyes <br/>
whose breasts still bear the stress <br/>
whose silver, copper, vermeil cargo lies <br/>
obscurely inside barrels <br/>
half-wedged and left to rot <br/>
we are the half-destroyed instruments <br/>
that once held to a course <br/>
the water-eaten log <br/>
the fouled compass <br/>

We are, I am, you are <br/>
by cowardice or courage <br/>
the one who find our way <br/>
back to this scene <br/>
carrying a knife, a camera <br/>
a book of myths <br/>
in which <br/>
our names do not appear. <br/>


## For a Friend in Travail
---

*From [An Atlas of the Difficult World](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1014839412)*.

Waking from violence:&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;the surgeon’s probe left in the foot <br/>
paralyzing the body from the waist down. <br/>
Dark before dawn:&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;wrapped in a shawl, to walk the house <br/>
the Drinking-Gourd slung in the northwest, <br/>
half-slice of moon to the south <br/>
through dark panes.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A time to speak to you.

*What are you going through?* she said, is the great question. <br/>
Philosopher of oppression, theorist <br/>
of the victories of force.

We write from the marrow of our bones.    What she did not <br/>
ask, or tell:&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;how victims save their own lives. <br/>


That crawl along the ledge, then the ravelling span of fibre <br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;strung <br/>
from one side to the other, I’ve dreamed that too. <br/>
Waking, not sure we made it.    Relief, appallment, of waking. <br/>
Consciousness.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;O, no.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To sleep again. <br/>
O to sleep without dreaming.

How day breaks, when it breaks, how clear and light the moon <br/>
melting into moon-colored air <br/>
moist and sweet, here on the western edge. <br/>
Love for the world, and we are part of it. <br/>

How the poppies break from their sealed envelopes <br/>
she did not tell. <br/>
What are you going through, there on the other edge?

1990

## Hubble [[Photographs]]: After Sappho
---

*From [Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth : Poems 2004-2006](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/286487122)*.

It should be the most desired sight of all <br/>
the person with whom you hope to live and die

walking into a room, turning to look at you, sight for sight <br/>
Should be yet I say there is something

more desirable: the ex-stasis of galaxies <br/>
so out from us there’s no vocabulary

but mathematics and optics <br/>
equations letting sight pierce through time

into liberations, lacerations of light and dust <br/>
exposed like a body’s cavity, violet green livid and venous, gorgeous

beyond good and evil as ever stained into dream <br/>
beyond remorse, disillusion, fear of death

or life, rage <br/>
for order, rage for destruction

—beyond this love which stirs <br/>
the air every time she walks into the room

These impersonae, however we call them <br/>
won’t invade us as on movie screens

they are so old, so new, we are not to them <br/>
we look at them or don’t from within the milky gauze

of our tilted gazing <br/>
but they don’t look back and we cannot hurt them
