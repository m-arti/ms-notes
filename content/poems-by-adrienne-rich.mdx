These are some of my favourite [[poems]] by [[Adrienne Rich]].

## Atlas of the Difficult World, XIII (Dedications)

*From [An Atlas of the Difficult World](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1014839412)*.

I know you are reading this poem <br/>
late, before leaving your office <br/>
of the one intense yellow lamp-spot and the darkening window <br/>
in the lassitude of a building faded to quiet <br/>
long after rush-hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you are reading this poem <br/>
standing up in a bookstore far from the ocean <br/>
on a gray day of early spring, faint flakes driven <br/>
across the plains' enormous spaces around you. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem <br/>
in a room where too much has happened for you to bear <br/>
where the bedclothes lie in stagnant coils on the bed <br/>
and the open valise speaks of flight <br/>
but you cannot leave yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you are reading this poem <br/>
as the underground train loses momentum and before running <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the stairs <br/>
toward a new kind of love <br/>
your life has never allowed. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem by the light <br/>
of the television screen where soundless images jerk and slide <br/>
while you wait for the newscast from the *intifada*. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem in a waiting-room <br/>
of eyes met and unmeeting, of identity with strangers. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem by fluorescent light <br/>
in the boredom and fatigue of the young who are counted out, <br/>
count themselves out, at too early an age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know <br/>
you are reading this poem through your failing sight, the thick <br/>
lens enlarging these letters beyond all meaning yet you read on <br/>
because even the alphabet is precious. <br/><br/>

I know you are reading this poem as you pace beside the stove <br/>
warming milk, a crying child on your shoulder, a book in your hand <br/>
because life is short and you too are thirsty. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem which is not in your language <br/>
guessing at some words while others keep you reading <br/>
and I want to know which words they are. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem listening for something, torn <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between bitterness and hope <br/>
turning back once again to the task you cannot refuse. <br/>
I know you are reading this poem because there is nothing <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else left to read <br/>
there where you have landed, stripped as you are.

## Cartographies of [[Silence]]

*From [The Dream of a Common Language: Poems
1974–1977](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/942544391)*.

<div><b>1.</b></div>

A conversation begins <br/>
with a lie. And each <br/>

speaker of the so-called common language feels <br/>
the ice-floe split, the drift apart <br/>

as if powerless, as if up against <br/>
a force of nature <br/>

A poem can begin <br/>
with a lie. And be torn up. <br/>

A conversation has other laws <br/>
recharges itself with its own <br/>

false energy. Cannot be torn <br/>
up. Infiltrates our blood. Repeats itself. <br/>

Inscribes with its unreturning stylus <br/>
the isolation it denies. <br/>

<div><b>2.</b></div>

The classical music station <br/>
playing hour upon hour in the apartment <br/>

the picking up and picking up <br/>
and again picking up the telephone <br/>

the syllables uttering <br/>
the old script over and over <br/>

The loneliness of the liar <br/>
living in the formal network of the lie <br/>

twisting the dials to drown the terror <br/>
beneath the unsaid word <br/>

<div><b>3.</b></div>

The technology of science <br/>
The rituals, the etiquette <br/>

the blurring of terms <br/>
silence not absence <br/>

of words or music or even <br/>
raw sounds <br/>

Silence can be a plan <br/>
rigorously executed <br/>

the blueprint to a life <br/>

It is a presence <br/>
it has a history &emsp;&emsp; a form <br/>

Do not confuse it <br/>
with any kind of absence <br/>

<div><b>4.</b></div>

How calm, how inoffensive these words <br/>
begin to seem to me <br/>

though begun in grief and anger <br/>
Can I break through this film of the abstract <br/>

without wounding myself or you <br/>
there is enough pain here <br/>

This is why the classical or the jazz music station plays? <br/>
to give a ground of meaning to our pain? <br/>


<div><b>5.</b></div>

The silence that strips bare: <br/>
In Dreyer’s *Passion of Joan* <br/>

Falconetti’s face, hair shorn, a great geography <br/>
mutely surveyed by the camera <br/>

If there were a poetry where this could happen <br/>
not as blank spaces or as words <br/>

stretched like skin over meanings <br/>
but as silence falls at the end <br/>

of a night through which two people <br/>
have talked till dawn <br/>

<div><b>6.</b></div>

The scream <br/>
of an illegitimate voice <br/>

It has ceased to hear itself, therefore <br/>
it asks itself <br/>

How do I exist? <br/>

This was the silence I wanted to break in you <br/>
I had questions but you would not answer <br/>

I had answers but you could not use them <br/>
This is useless to you and perhaps to others <br/>

<div><b>7.</b></div>

It was an old theme even for me: <br/>
Language cannot do everything– <br/>

chalk it on the walls where the dead poets <br/>
lie in their mausoleums <br/>

If at the will of the poet the poem <br/>
could turn into a thing <br/>

a granite flank laid bare, a lifted head <br/>
alight with dew <br/>

It if could simply look you in the face <br/>
with naked eyeballs, not letting you turn <br/>

till you, and I who long to make this thing, <br/>
were finally clarified together in its stare <br/>

<div><b>8.</b></div>

No. Let me have this dust, <br/>
these pale clouds dourly lingering, these words <br/>

moving with ferocious accuracy <br/>
like the blind child’s fingers <br/>

or the newborn infant’s mouth <br/>
violent with hunger <br/>

No one can give me, I have long ago <br/>
taken this method <br/>

whether of bran pouring from the loose-woven sack <br/>
or of the bunsen-flame turned low and blue <br/>

If from time to time I envy <br/>
the pure annunciations to the eye <br/>

the *visio beatifica* <br/>
if from time to time I long to turn <br/>

like the Eleusinian hierophant <br/>
holding up a simple ear of grain <br/>

for the return to the concrete and everlasting world <br/>
what in fact I keep choosing <br/>

are these words, these whispers, these conversations <br/>
from which time after time the truth breaks moist and green <br/>

## Diving into the Wreck

*From [Diving into the Wreck - Poems 1971-1972.](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1023182819)*

First having read the book of myths, <br/>
and loaded the camera, <br/>
and checked the edge of the knife-blade, <br/>
I put on <br/>
the body-armor of black rubber <br/>
the absurd flippers <br/>
the grave and awkward mask. <br/>
I am having to do this <br/>
not like Cousteau with his <br/>
assiduous team <br/>
aboard the sun-flooded schooner <br/>
but here alone.

There is a ladder. <br/>
The ladder is always there <br/>
hanging innocently <br/>
close to the side of the schooner. <br/>
We know what it is for, <br/>
we who have used it. <br/>
Otherwise <br/>
it is a piece of maritime floss <br/>
some sundry equipment. <br/>

I go down. <br/>
Rung after rung and still <br/>
the oxygen immerses me <br/>
the blue light <br/>
the clear atoms <br/>
of our human air. <br/>
I go down. <br/>
My flippers cripple me, <br/>
I crawl like an insect down the ladder <br/>
and there is no one <br/>
to tell me when the ocean <br/>
will begin. <br/>

First the air is blue and then <br/>
it is bluer and then green and then <br/>
black I am blacking out and yet <br/>
my mask is powerful <br/>
it pumps my blood with power <br/>
the sea is another story <br/>
the sea is not a question of power <br/>
I have to learn alone <br/>
to turn my body without force <br/>
in the deep element. <br/>

And now: it is easy to forget <br/>
what I came for <br/>
among so many who have always <br/>
lived here <br/>
swaying their crenellated fans <br/>
between the reefs <br/>
and besides <br/>
you breathe differently down here. <br/>

I came to explore the wreck. <br/>
The words are purposes. <br/>
The words are maps. <br/>
I came to see the damage that was done <br/>
and the treasures that prevail. <br/>
I stroke the beam of my lamp <br/>
slowly along the flank <br/>
of something more permanent <br/>
than fish or weed <br/>

the thing I came for: <br/>
the wreck and not the story of the wreck <br/>
the thing itself and not the myth <br/>
the drowned face always staring <br/>
toward the sun <br/>
the evidence of damage <br/>
worn by salt and sway into this threadbare beauty <br/>
the ribs of the disaster <br/>
curving their assertion <br/>
among the tentative haunters. <br/>

This is the place. <br/>
And I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair <br/>
streams black, the merman in his armored body. <br/>
We circle silently <br/>
about the wreck <br/>
we dive into the hold. <br/>
I am she: I am he <br/>

whose drowned face sleeps with open eyes <br/>
whose breasts still bear the stress <br/>
whose silver, copper, vermeil cargo lies <br/>
obscurely inside barrels <br/>
half-wedged and left to rot <br/>
we are the half-destroyed instruments <br/>
that once held to a course <br/>
the water-eaten log <br/>
the fouled compass <br/>

We are, I am, you are <br/>
by cowardice or courage <br/>
the one who find our way <br/>
back to this scene <br/>
carrying a knife, a camera <br/>
a book of myths <br/>
in which <br/>
our names do not appear. <br/>


## For a Friend in Travail

*From [An Atlas of the Difficult World](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1014839412)*.

Waking from violence:&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;the surgeon’s probe left in the foot <br/>
paralyzing the body from the waist down. <br/>
Dark before dawn:&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;wrapped in a shawl, to walk the house <br/>
the Drinking-Gourd slung in the northwest, <br/>
half-slice of moon to the south <br/>
through dark panes.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A time to speak to you.

*What are you going through?* she said, is the great question. <br/>
Philosopher of oppression, theorist <br/>
of the victories of force.

We write from the marrow of our bones.    What she did not <br/>
ask, or tell:&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;how victims save their own lives. <br/>


That crawl along the ledge, then the ravelling span of fibre <br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;strung <br/>
from one side to the other, I’ve dreamed that too. <br/>
Waking, not sure we made it.    Relief, appallment, of waking. <br/>
Consciousness.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;O, no.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To sleep again. <br/>
O to sleep without dreaming.

How day breaks, when it breaks, how clear and light the moon <br/>
melting into moon-colored air <br/>
moist and sweet, here on the western edge. <br/>
Love for the world, and we are part of it. <br/>

How the poppies break from their sealed envelopes <br/>
she did not tell. <br/>
What are you going through, there on the other edge?

1990

## For the Record

*From [Your Native Land, Your Life](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908298031)*.

The clouds and the stars didn’t wage this war <br/>
the brooks gave no information <br/>
if the mountain spewed stones of fire into the river <br/>
it was not taking sides <br/>
the raindrop faintly swaying under the leaf <br/>
had no political opinions

and if here or there a house <br/>
filled with backed-up raw sewage <br/>
or poisoned those who lived there <br/>
with slow fumes, over years <br/>
the houses were not at war <br/>
nor did the tinned-up buildings

intend to refuse shelter <br/>
to homeless old women and roaming children <br/>
they had no policy to keep them roaming <br/>
or dying, no, the cities were not the problem <br/>
the bridges were non-partisan <br/>
the freeways burned, but not with hatred

Even the miles of barbed-wire <br/>
stretched around crouching temporary huts <br/>
designed to keep the unwanted <br/>
at a safe distance, out of sight <br/>
even the boards that had to absorb <br/>
year upon year, so many human sounds

so many depths of vomit, tears <br/>
slow-soaking blood <br/>
had not offered themselves for this <br/>
The trees didn’t volunteer to be cut into boards <br/>
nor the thorns for tearing flesh <br/>
Look around at all of it

and ask whose signature <br/>
is stamped on the orders, traced <br/>
in the corner of the building plans <br/>
Ask where the illiterate, big-bellied <br/>
women were, the drunks and crazies, <br/>
the ones you fear most of all: ask where you were.


## Hubble [[Photographs]]: After Sappho

*From [Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth : Poems 2004-2006](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/286487122)*.

It should be the most desired sight of all <br/>
the person with whom you hope to live and die

walking into a room, turning to look at you, sight for sight <br/>
Should be yet I say there is something

more desirable: the ex-stasis of galaxies <br/>
so out from us there’s no vocabulary

but mathematics and optics <br/>
equations letting sight pierce through time

into liberations, lacerations of light and dust <br/>
exposed like a body’s cavity, violet green livid and venous, gorgeous

beyond good and evil as ever stained into dream <br/>
beyond remorse, disillusion, fear of death

or life, rage <br/>
for order, rage for destruction

—beyond this love which stirs <br/>
the air every time she walks into the room

These impersonae, however we call them <br/>
won’t invade us as on movie screens

they are so old, so new, we are not to them <br/>
we look at them or don’t from within the milky gauze

of our tilted gazing <br/>
but they don’t look back and we cannot hurt them

## Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law

*From [Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law: Poems, 1954-1962](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/977093836)*.

<div><b>1</b></div>

You, once a belle in Shreveport, <br/>
with henna-colored hair, skin like a peachbud, <br/>
still have your dresses copied from that time, <br/>
and play a Chopin prelude <br/>
called by Cortot: "Delicious recollections <br/>
float like perfume through the memory." <br/>

Your mind now, moldering like wedding-cake, <br/>
heavy with useless experience, rich <br/>
with suspicion, rumor, fantasy, <br/>
crumbling to pieces under the knife-edge <br/>
of mere fact. In the prime of your life.

Nervy, glowering, your daughter <br/>
wipes the teaspoons, grows another way.

<div><b>2</b></div>

Banging the coffee-pot into the sink <br/>
she hears the angels chiding, and looks out <br/>
past the raked gardens to the sloppy sky. <br/>
Only a week since They said: Have no patience.

The next time it was: Be insatiable. <br/>
Then: Save yourself; others you cannot save. <br/>
Sometimes she's let the tapstream scald her arm, <br/>
a match burn to her thumbnail,

or held her hand above the kettle's snout <br/>
right inthe woolly steam. They are probably angels, <br/>
since nothing hurts her anymore, except <br/>
each morning's grit blowing into her eyes.

<div><b>3</b></div>

A thinking woman sleeps with monsters. <br/>
The beak that grips her, she becomes. And Nature, <br/>
that sprung-lidded, still commodious <br/>
steamer-trunk of tempora and mores <br/>
gets stuffed with it all: the mildewed orange-flowers, <br/>
the female pills, the terrible breasts <br/>
of Boadicea beneath flat foxes' heads and orchids. <br/>
Two handsome women, gripped in argument, <br/>
each proud, acute, subtle, I hear scream <br/>
across the cut glass and majolica <br/>
like Furies cornered from their prey: <br/>
The argument ad feminam, all the old knives <br/>
that have rusted in my back, I drive in yours, <br/>
ma semblable, ma soeur!

<div><b>4</b></div>

Knowing themselves too well in one another: <br/>
their gifts no pure fruition, but a thorn, <br/>
the prick filed sharp against a hint of scorn... <br/>
Reading while waiting <br/>
for the iron to heat, <br/>
writing, My Life had stood--a Loaded Gun-- <br/>
in that Amherst pantry while the jellies boil and scum, <br/>
or, more often, <br/>
iron-eyed and beaked and purposed as a bird, <br/>
dusting everything on the whatnot every day of life.

<div><b>5</b></div>

Dulce ridens, dulce loquens, <br/>
she shaves her legs until they gleam <br/>
like petrified mammoth-tusk.

<div><b>6</b></div>

When to her lute Corinna sings <br/>
neither words nor music are her own; <br/>
only the long hair dipping <br/>
over her cheek, only the song <br/>
of silk against her knees <br/>
and these <br/>
adjusted in reflections of an eye.

Poised, trembling and unsatisfied, before <br/>
an unlocked door, that cage of cages, <br/>
tell us, you bird, you tragical machine-- <br/>
is this fertillisante douleur? Pinned down <br/>
by love, for you the only natural action, <br/>
are you edged more keen <br/>
to prise the secrets of the vault? has Nature shown <br/>
her household books to you, daughter-in-law, <br/>
that her sons never saw?

<div><b>7</b></div>

"To have in this uncertain world some stay <br/>
which cannot be undermined, is <br/>
of the utmost consequence." <br/>
Thus wrote <br/>
a woman, partly brave and partly good, <br/>
who fought with what she partly understood. <br/>
Few men about her would or could do more, <br/>
hence she was labeled harpy, shrew and whore.

<div><b>8</b></div>

"You all die at fifteen," said Diderot, <br/>
and turn part legend, part convention. <br/>
Still, eyes inaccurately dream <br/>
behind closed windows blankening with steam. <br/>
Deliciously, all that we might have been, <br/>
all that we were--fire, tears, <br/>
wit, taste, martyred ambition-- <br/>
stirs like the memory of refused adultery <br/>
the drained and flagging bosom of our middle years.

<div><b>9</b></div>

Not that it is done well, but <br/>
that it is done at all? Yes, think <br/>
of the odds! or shrug them off forever. <br/>
This luxury of the precocious child, <br/>
Time's precious chronic invalid,-- <br/>
would we, darlings, resign it if we could? <br/>
Our blight has been our sinecure: <br/>
mere talent was enough for us-- <br/>
glitter in fragments and rough drafts.

Sigh no more, ladies. <br/>
Time is male <br/>
and in his cups drinks to the fair. <br/>
Bemused by gallantry, we hear <br/>
our mediocrities over-praised, <br/>
indolence read as abnegation, <br/>
slattern thought styled intuition, <br/>
every lapse forgiven, our crime <br/>
only to cast too bold a shadow <br/>
or smash the mold straight off. <br/>
For that, solitary confinement, <br/>
tear gas, attrition shelling. <br/>
Few applicants for that honor.

<div><b>10</b></div>

Well, <br/>
she's long about her coming, who must be <br/>
more merciless to herself than history. <br/>
Her mind full to the wind, I see her plunge <br/>
breasted and glancing through the currents, <br/>
taking the light upon her <br/>
at least as beautiful as any boy <br/>
or helicopter, <br/>
poised, still coming, <br/>
her fine blades making the air wince

but her cargo <br/>
no promise then: <br/>
delivered <br/>
palpable <br/>
ours.
