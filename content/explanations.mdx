In [*The Structure of Science*](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/231599) (subtitled *The Problems in the Logic of Scientific Explanation*), the philosopher Ernest Nagel outlined four kinds of explanations that are common in scientific works. They are the following, each briefly explained [1, 2]:

1. **Deductive explanations**: in these, the thing being explained (*explicandum*) is a valid logical conclusion of an argument that must have more than one premise. Having established good reasons for them to be true, these premises should: have some initial conditions; a general law; and, entail the conclusion, but not be entailed by it.

2. **Probabilistic explanations**: in these, the premises for explanation do not lead to a logical conclusion of the *explicandum*, but they make it probable.

3. **Functional or teleological explanations**: whereby the *explicandum* is explained in terms of its function in a larger system or in causing something.

4. **Genetic explanations**: in this case, a sequence of real events constitute the premises for an explanation. It is impossible to explain a thing without following its complete history of occurrences.
