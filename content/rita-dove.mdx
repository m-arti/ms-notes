> Some people's minds run from point A to point B with the linear determination of an express bus roaring from stop to distant stop. Theirs are minds trained to avoid detours, to cut a path past the alleys and side streets of distraction. Rita's mind is more like the water of a stream swirling randomly, chaotically and unpredictably over the stones below as it still flows resolutely downstream... Rita is not like those who see tangential thoughts as distracting digressions: "I'm interested in the sidetracking."

— Walt Harrington, [*"The Shape of Her Dreaming — Rita Dove Writes a Poem"*](http://people.virginia.edu/~rfd4b/dreaming.pdf) (1995, The Washington Post)

These are some of my favourite [[poems]] by Rita Dove. They're all in [*Collected Poems: 1974-2004*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/collected-poems-1974-2004/oclc/1023358733).

## Dawn Revisited
---

Imagine you wake up <br/>
with a second chance: The blue jay <br/>
hawks his pretty wares <br/>
and the oak still stands, spreading <br/>
glorious shade. If you don't look back, <br/>

the future never happens. <br/>
How good to rise in sunlight, <br/>
in the prodigal smell of biscuits— <br/>
eggs and sausage on the grill. <br/>
The whole sky is yours

to write on, blown open <br/>
to a blank page. Come on, <br/>
shake a leg! You'll never know <br/>
who's down there, frying those eggs, <br/>
if you don't get up and see.

## The Fish in the Stone
---

The fish in the stone <br/>
would like to fall <br/>
back into the sea.

He is weary <br/>
of analysis, the small <br/>
predictable truths. <br/>
He is weary of waiting <br/>
in the open, <br/>
his profile stamped <br/>
by a white light.

In the ocean the silence <br/>
moves and moves

and so much is unncessary! <br/>
Patient, he drifts <br/>
until the moment comes <br/>
to cast his <br/>
skeletal blossom.

The fish in the stone <br/>
knows to fail is <br/>
to do the living <br/>
a favor

He knows why the ant <br/>
engineers a gangster's <br/>
funeral, garish <br/>
and perfectly amber. <br/>
He knows why the scientist <br/>
in secret delight <br/>
strokes the fern's <br/>
voluptuous braille.

## Mother Love
---

Who can forget the attitude of mothering? <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Toss me a baby and without bothering <br/>
To blink I'll catch her, sling him on a hip. <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Any woman knows the remedy for grief <br/>
is being needed: duty bugles and we'll <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; climb out of exhaustion every time,

bare the nipple or tuck in the sheet, <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; heat milk and hum at bedside until <br/>
they can dress themselves and rise, primed <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; for Love or Glory—those one-way mirrors <br/>
girls peer into as their fledging heroes slip <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; through, storming the smoky battlefield.

So when this kind woman approached at the urging <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; of her bouquet of daughters <br/>
(one for each of the world's corners, <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; one for each of the winds to scatter!) <br/>
and offered up her only male child for nursing <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (a smattering of flesh, noisy and ordinary), <br/>
I put aside the lavish trousseau of the mourner <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; for the daintier comfort of pity: <br/>
I decided to save him. Each night <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I laid him on the smoldering embers, <br/>
sealing his juices in slowly so he might <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; be cured to perfection. Oh, I know it <br/>
looked damning: at the hearth a muttering crone <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; bent over a baby sizzling on a spit <br/>
as neat as a Virginia ham. Poor human— <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; to scream like that, to make me remember.

## November for Beginners
---

Snow would be the easy <br/>
way out—that softening <br/>
sky like a sigh of relief <br/>
at finally being allowed <br/>
to yield. No dice. <br/>
We stack twigs for burning <br/>
in glistening patches <br/>
but the rain won't give. <br/>

So we wait, breeding <br/>
mood, making music <br/>
of decline. We sit down <br/>
in the smell of the past <br/>
and rise in a light <br/>
that is already leaving. <br/>
We ache in secret, <br/>
memorizing <br/>

a gloomy line <br/>
or two of German. <br/>
When spring comes <br/>
we promise to act <br/>
the fool. Pour, <br/>
rain! Sail, wind, <br/>
with your cargo of zithers!

## Pithos

Climb <br/>
into a jar <br/>
and live <br/>
for a while. <br/>

Chill earth. <br/>
No stars <br/>
in this stone <br/>
sky. <br/>

You have ceased <br/>
to ache. <br/>

Your spine is <br/>
a flower.

## On the Road to Damascus

> And it came to pass, that, as I made my <br/>
> journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus <br/>
> about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven <br/>
> a great light round about me. And I fell to the <br/>
> ground \. \. \. <br/>

<div style="width:350px; margin-top:-10px">
  <p className='font-serif text-right'> ACTS 22:6–7 </p>
</div>

They say I was struck down by the voice of an angel: <br/>
&emsp; flames poured through the radiant fabric of heaven <br/>
as I cried out and fell on my knees. <br/>

My fist recollection was of Unbroken Blue— <br/>
&emsp; but two of the guards have already sworn by <br/>
the tip of my tongue set ablaze. As an official, <br/>

I recognize the lure of a good story: <br/>
&emsp; useless to suggest that my mount <br/>
had stumbled, that I was pitched into a clump

of wild chamomile, its familiar stink <br/>
&emsp; soothing even as my plans sprang blisters <br/>
under the nicked leaves. I heard shouts, <br/>

the horse pissing in terror—but my eyes <br/>
&emsp; had dropped to my knees, and I saw nothing. <br/>
I was a Roman and had my business

among the clouded towers of Damascus. <br/>
&emsp; I had not counted on earth rearing, <br/>
honey streaming down a parched sky, <br/>

a spear skewering me to the dust of the road <br/>
&emsp; on the way to the city I would never <br/>
enter now, her markets steaming with vendors

and compatriots in careless armor lifting a hand <br/>
&emsp; in greeting as they call out my name, <br/>
only to find no one home.

## Straw Hat
---

In the city, under the saw-toothed leaves of an oak <br/>
overlooking the tracks, he sits out <br/>
the last minutes before dawn, lucky <br/>
to sleep third shift. Years before <br/>
he was anything, he lay on <br/>
so many kinds of grass, under stars, <br/>
the moon's bald eye opposing. <br/>

He used to sleep like a glass of water <br/>
held up in the hand of a very young girl. <br/>
Then he learned he wasn't perfect, that <br/>
no one was perfect. So he made his way <br/>
North under the bland roof of a tent <br/>
too small for even his lean body. <br/>

The mattress ticking he shares in the work barracks <br/>
is brown and smells <br/>
from the sweat of two other men. <br/>
One of them chews snuff: <br/>
he's never met either. <br/>
To him, work is a narrow grief <br/>
and the music afterwards <br/>
is like a woman <br/>
reaching into his chest <br/>
to spread it around. When he sings <br/>

he closes his eyes. <br/>
He never knows when she'll be coming <br/>
but when she leaves, he always <br/>
tips his hat.

## Under the Viaduct, 1932
---

He avoided the empty millyards, <br/>
the households towering <br/>
next to the curb. It was dark <br/>
where he walked, although above him <br/>
the traffic was hissing. <br/>

he poked a trail in the mud <br/>
with his tin-capped stick. <br/>
If he had a son this time <br/>
he would teach him how to step <br/>

between his family and the police, <br/>
the mob bellowing <br/>
as a kettle of communal soup <br/>
spilled over a gray bank of clothes\. \. \. \.

The pavement wobbled, loosened by rain. <br/>
he liked it down here <br/>
where the luck of the mighty <br/>
had tumbled, <br/>

black suit and collarbone. <br/>
He could smell the worms stirring in their holes. <br/>
He could watch the white sheet settle <br/>
while all across the North Hill Viaduct

tires slithered to a halt.

## Variation on Guilt
---

Count is anyway he wants— <br/>
by the waiting room clock, <br/>
by the lengthening hangnail, <br/>
by his buttons, the cigars crackling <br/>
in cellophane— <br/>

no explosion. No latch clangs <br/>
home. Perfect bystander, high <br/>
and dry with a scream caught <br/>
in his throat, he looks down <br/>

the row of faces coddled <br/>
in anxious pride. Wretched <br/>
little difference, he thinks, <br/>
between enduring pain and <br/>
waiting for pain <br/>
to work on others. <br/>

The doors fly apart—no, <br/>
he wouldn't run away! <br/>
It's a girl, he can tell
by that smirk, that strut of a mountebank! <br/>

But he doesn't feel a thing. <br/>
Weak with rage, <br/>
Thomas deals the cigars, <br/>
spits out the bitter tip in tears.
