I aim to use this medium for iterating through thoughts and ideas, on topics such as computation, art and literature, which presently are my most fond of interests. You may also find quotes, draft esssays and poems.

I like the idea of computational notebooks and I use them for [[note-taking]]. With this medium, I'm exploring new ways of extending [[wolfram-notebooks]].

The [[meta]] note narrates how this idea came about, and in it you'll find an in-depth walk-through of this site.
