I aim to use this medium for iterating through thoughts and ideas, on topics such as computation, art and literature, which presently are my most fond of interests. You may also find quotes, draft esssays and poems.

With this medium, I shall be exploring new ways of extending [[wolfram-notebooks]]. I like the idea of computational notebooks and quite enjoy using them for [[note-taking]]. I find Wolfram Notebooks particularly apt for exploring ideas and thinking about the world in general. I will be using standalone or embedded notebooks to share ideas and [[exploration]]s here.

The ever-changing [[meta]] note narrates how this idea came about, and in it you'll find an in-depth walk-through of this site.
