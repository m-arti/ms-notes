I am curating dataset of popular scientists from all over the world, based on Eric Weisstein's [World of Science](https://scienceworld.wolfram.com). In the notebook below I show how I've curated the data and how I'm dealing with real-world entities.

My goal is to eventually submit this dataset to the [Wolfram Data Repository](https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/), and do an Exploratory Data Analysis (see [[exploration]]s) on it.
