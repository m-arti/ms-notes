This is a collection of different types/sources of *dynamic objects*, i.e., computational artefacts that're interactive and responsive. What distinguishes these from other kinds of embedded objects is that these allow you some degree of freedom, whereas others simply render a playback.

Beyond interaction, they also facilitate creativity—possibilities that're to some extent boundless. However, they're restrained by the bounds this medium, the web browser, which is itself restrained by the medium of the computer.

  <p>
    Think, for instance, about how typing and clicking as the dominant modes of input limit how we interact with computers. That is, personal computers. Or, how sound is rarely used on websites, except for music and videos. There're some good reasons for why this is case: speed, focus, ergonomics, and so on. But there're downsides too, and some relate to those same reasons. It's possible that we could think and act faster if we can navigate interfaces in multiple ways, not just with our fingers. Maybe we can focus better and use computers with greater comfort, if don't have everthing squashed into a screen.
    <br/><br/>
    These ideas aren't new and have been mulled over by many people, and for a very long time too. The PC has come a long way and it continues to improve. Not only is it getting faster, it's becoming more accessible and allowing us to be more creative. We can be far more creative with PCs. To attain this would require rethinking how we use and interact with them.

    Interface matters to me more than anything else, and it always has. I just never realized that. I've spent a lot of time over the years desperately trying to think of a "thing" to change the world. I now know why the search was fruitless — things don't change the world. People change the world by using things. The focus must be on the "using", not the "thing". Now that I'm looking through the right end of the binoculars, I can see a lot more clearly, and there are projects and possibilities that genuinely interest me deeply.

## Wolfram Notebook

I've previously written about [[Wolfram Notebooks]]. This is a blank one. Here are some things to try: `N[Pi,50]`, `Now`, `{Sunrise[],Sunset[]}` `WikipediaData["Computer","SummaryPlaintext"]`, `GeoGraphics[GeoMarker[]]`.

## React Live

Dynamically updated code/preview using [React Live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live). Edit the code to update the text in real-time.

<div>
  <LiveProvider code={`<p>Hello world!</p>`}>
    <LiveEditor theme={theme} className="text-md font-bold rounded bg-gray-50 dark:bg-opacity-50 dark:bg-gray-950"/>
    <LivePreview className="pt-2 text-md overflow-x"/>
    <LiveError className="m-2 rounded overflow text-xs text-red-500 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-opacity-50 dark:bg-gray-950"/>
  </LiveProvider>
</div>

<div>
  <LiveProvider code={
    `<div style={{ background: "LightGoldenRodYellow" }}>
      <h1 className='font-serif p-12' style={{ color: "DarkOliveGreen", textAlign: "center" }}>
        Hello there! <br/>
        Edit the code to update this text.
