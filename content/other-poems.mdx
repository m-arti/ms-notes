## *blessing the boats* — Lucille Clifton
---
(at St. Mary’s)<br/><br/>
may the tide<br/>
that is entering even now<br/>
the lip of our understanding<br/>
carry you out<br/>
beyond the face of fear<br/>
may you kiss<br/>
the wind then turn from it<br/>
certain that it will<br/>
love your back &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may you<br/>
open your eyes to water<br/>
water waving forever<br/>
and may you in your innocence<br/>
sail through this to that

## *Kindness* — Naomi Shihab Nye
---
Before you know what kindness really is <br/>
you must lose things, <br/>
feel the future dissolve in a moment <br/>
like salt in a weakened broth. <br/>
What you held in your hand, <br/>
what you counted and carefully saved, <br/>
all this must go so you know <br/>
how desolate the landscape can be <br/>
between the regions of kindness. <br/>
How you ride and ride <br/>
thinking the bus will never stop, <br/>
the passengers eating maize and chicken <br/>
will stare out the window forever. <br/>

Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness, <br/>
you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho <br/>
lies dead [1] by the side of the road. <br/>
You must see how this could be you, <br/>
how he too was someone <br/>
who journeyed through the night with plans <br/>
and the simple breath that kept him alive. <br/>

Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside, <br/>
you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing. <br/>
You must wake up with sorrow. <br/>
You must speak to it till your voice <br/>
catches the thread of all sorrows <br/>
and you see the size of the cloth. <br/>

Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore, <br/>
only kindness that ties your shoes <br/>
and sends you out into the day to gaze at bread, <br/>
only kindness that raises its head <br/>
from the crowd of the world to say <br/>
It is I you have been looking for, <br/>
and then goes with you everywhere <br/>
like a shadow or a friend.

## *Love After Love* — Derek Walcott
---

The time will come <br/>
when, with elation <br/>
you will greet yourself arriving <br/>
at your own door, in your own mirror <br/>
and each will smile at the other's welcome, <br/>

and say, sit here. Eat. <br/>
You will love again the stranger who was your self. <br/>
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart <br/>
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you <br/> <br/>

all your life, whom you ignored <br/>
for another, who knows you by heart. <br/>
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf, <br/>

the photographs, the desperate notes, <br/>
peel your own image from the mirror. <br/>
Sit. Feast on your life.

<br/>

### Notes

[1] Sadly, this was based on a real event, which Shihab Nye narrates here:
