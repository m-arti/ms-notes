## *blessing the boats* — Lucille Clifton
(at St. Mary’s)<br/><br/>
may the tide<br/>
that is entering even now<br/>
the lip of our understanding<br/>
carry you out<br/>
beyond the face of fear<br/>
may you kiss<br/>
the wind then turn from it<br/>
certain that it will<br/>
love your back &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may you<br/>
open your eyes to water<br/>
water waving forever<br/>
and may you in your innocence<br/>
sail through this to that

## *Kindness* — Naomi Shihab Nye
Before you know what kindness really is <br/>
you must lose things, <br/>
feel the future dissolve in a moment <br/>
like salt in a weakened broth. <br/>
What you held in your hand, <br/>
what you counted and carefully saved, <br/>
all this must go so you know <br/>
how desolate the landscape can be <br/>
between the regions of kindness. <br/>
How you ride and ride <br/>
thinking the bus will never stop, <br/>
the passengers eating maize and chicken <br/>
will stare out the window forever. <br/>

Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness, <br/>
you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho <br/>
lies dead [1] by the side of the road. <br/>
You must see how this could be you, <br/>
how he too was someone <br/>
who journeyed through the night with plans <br/>
and the simple breath that kept him alive. <br/>

Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside, <br/>
you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing. <br/>
You must wake up with sorrow. <br/>
You must speak to it till your voice <br/>
catches the thread of all sorrows <br/>
and you see the size of the cloth. <br/>

Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore, <br/>
only kindness that ties your shoes <br/>
and sends you out into the day to gaze at bread, <br/>
only kindness that raises its head <br/>
from the crowd of the world to say <br/>
It is I you have been looking for, <br/>
and then goes with you everywhere <br/>
like a shadow or a friend.

## *Love After Love* — Derek Walcott

The time will come <br/>
when, with elation <br/>
you will greet yourself arriving <br/>
at your own door, in your own mirror <br/>
and each will smile at the other's welcome, <br/>

and say, sit here. Eat. <br/>
You will love again the stranger who was your self. <br/>
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart <br/>
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you <br/> <br/>

all your life, whom you ignored <br/>
for another, who knows you by heart. <br/>
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf, <br/>

the photographs, the desperate notes, <br/>
peel your own image from the mirror. <br/>
Sit. Feast on your life.

## *Phase One* — Dilruba Ahmed

For leaving the fridge open <br/>
last night, I forgive you. <br/>
For conjuring white curtains <br/>
instead of living your life.

For the seedlings that wilt, now, <br/>
in tiny pots, I forgive you. <br/>
For saying no first <br/>
but yes as an afterthought. <br/>

I forgive you for hideous visions <br/>
after childbirth, brought on by loss <br/>
of sleep. And when the baby woke <br/>
repeatedly, for your silent rebuke <br/>

in the dark, “What’s your beef?” <br/>
I forgive your letting vines <br/>
overtake the garden. For fearing <br/>
your own propensity to love. <br/>

For losing, again, your bag <br/>
en route from San Francisco; <br/>
for the equally heedless drive back <br/>
on the caffeine-fueled return. <br/>

I forgive you for leaving <br/>
windows open in rain <br/>
and soaking library books <br/>
again. For putting forth

only revisions of yourself, <br/>
with punctuation worked over, <br/>
instead of the disordered truth, <br/>
I forgive you. For singing mostly <br/>

when the shower drowns <br/>
your voice. For so admiring <br/>
the drummer you failed to hear <br/>
the drum. In forgotten tin cans,

may forgiveness gather. Pooling <br/>
in gutters. Gushing from pipes. <br/>
A great steady rain of olives <br/>
from branches, relieved

of cruelty and petty meanness. <br/>
With it, a flurry of wings, thirteen <br/>
gray pigeons. Ointment reserved <br/>
for healers and prophets. I forgive you.

I forgive you. For feeling awkward <br/>
and nervous without reason. <br/>
For bearing Keats’s empty vessel <br/>
with such calm you worried

you had, perhaps, no moral <br/>
center at all. For treating your mother <br/>
with contempt when she deserved <br/>
compassion. I forgive you. I forgive

you. I forgive you. For growing <br/>
a capacity for love that is great <br/>
but matched only, perhaps, <br/>
by your loneliness. For being unable

to forgive yourself first so you <br/>
could then forgive others and <br/>
at last find a way to become <br/>
the love that you want in this world.

### Notes

[1] Sadly, this was based on a real event, which Shihab Nye narrates here:
