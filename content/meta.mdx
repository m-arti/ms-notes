title: Meta Note
---

## Inspiration
---
I discovered the idea of the _Digital Garden_ while roaming Maggie Appleton's [site](https://maggieappleton.com/metatour). This was around the end of summer 2020. I had just created my [blog](https://blog.martinssamuel.com/), and was looking for a way to add [Tuftesque](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) sidenotes to posts.

When I encountered the [idea](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), I was fascinated by it and knew straightaway that I'd later return to it. Further reading led me to Andy Matuschak's [site](https://andymatuschak.org/), and eventually to Aravind Balla's [notes](https://notes.aravindballa.com/). I'd been thinking of taking computable notes using [[wolfram-notebooks]], and Aravind's layout seemed ideal for what I had in mind.

  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wolfram notebooks would make such a great computable notes app.</p>&mdash; @m_arti, <a href="https://twitter.com/m_arti/status/1225784947249754126">February 7, 2020</a>
</blockquote>

I like how plain and simple the layout is, and the seamless linking and transitions between notes. I also like that I can do my [[note-taking]] inside a Wolfram Notebook and publish it straightaway. Notebooks are versatile and dynamic.

A Wolfram Notebook can take the form of a formal document or a computational essay. Cells can be hidden automatically and only revealed when hovered over. One can set a background of any colour. Youtube videos, Soundcloud tracks and Bing maps can be embedded. It's possible to create a notebook-centric version of this theme. Pages will essentially be embedded notebooks. For Wolfram Notebooks, docked cells can hold tags and other meta information on each note. The only potential issue I currently see with this is internal links, such as [this](/).

## Aspirations
---
- [ ] [Automate](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/AutomatedReports.html) refreshing of meta notebook.
- [ ] Implement [images](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/using-gatsby-plugin-image) and Medium-like [zooming](https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom). Sometimes an image says it all.
- [ ] Make internal links in embedded notebooks open as a stacked page, and not as a new page in same/new browser tab.

For now I'll be updating its contents manually. Though in the future I might make it auto-update say, once every week,Â or whenever I add new note.
