## Inspiration
---

I discovered the idea of the _Digital Garden_ while roaming Maggie Appleton's [site](https://maggieappleton.com/metatour). This was around the end of summer 2020. I had just created my [blog](https://blog.martinssamuel.com/), and was looking for a way to add [Tuftesque](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) sidenotes to posts.

When I encountered the [idea](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), I was fascinated by it and knew straightaway that I'd later return to it. Further reading led me to Andy Matuschak's [site](https://andymatuschak.org/), and eventually to Aravind Balla's [notes](https://notes.aravindballa.com/). I'd been thinking of taking computable notes using [[wolfram-notebooks]], and Aravind's layout seemed ideal for what I had in mind.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wolfram notebooks would make such a great computable notes app.</p>&mdash; @m_arti, <a href="https://twitter.com/m_arti/status/1225784947249754126">February 7, 2020</a>
</blockquote>

I like how plain and simple the layout is, and the seamless linking and transitions between notes. I also like that I can do my [[note-taking]] inside a Wolfram Notebook and publish it straightaway. Notebooks are versatile and dynamic. A Wolfram Notebook can take the form of a formal document or a computational essay. Cells can be hidden automatically and only revealed when hovered over. One can set a background of any colour. Youtube videos, Soundcloud tracks and Bing maps can be embedded. These are just a few things one can do with them on the web.

It's possible to create a notebook-centric version of this theme. Pages will essentially be embedded notebooks (Julia, Jupyter, Wolfram, etc.). For Wolfram Notebooks, docked cells can hold tags and other meta information on each note. One potential issue I see with this is internal links. There's a potentially more serious issue: should Wolfram Cloud—for instance, which hosts Wolfram Notebooks—someday collapse, so shall the entire theme. Wolfram Notebooks aren't currently so widely used as to be hosted by third-party organisations.

## How it works
---

- __Design/Style__:
  The original theme is [here](https://github.com/aravindballa/notes.aravindballa.com); [my version](https://github.com/m-arti/ms-notes) has some edits. This site uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)—speed, efficiency, simplicity. For 'dark mode', I use a a Tailwind CSS plugin called [Nightwind](https://nightwindcss.com). Nightwind greatly simplifies the handling colours and other settings which differ between light/dark modes.

  To match the style of embedded Wolfram Notebooks to that of notes, I use a [stylesheet](https://github.com/m-arti/ms-notes/blob/master/src/style.wl). The matching isn't quite exact—this site uses the font 'SF Pro', while notebooks use 'Source Sans Pro'. To stylise a notebook, I can  run the following from within that notebook:
 ```
 SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[],
 StyleDefinitions -> Import["https://wolfr.am/U7U6ZSd2"]]
 ```

- __Notes__:
  Notes are `.mdx` files. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) combines the strengths of Markdown and JSX (an extension of Javascript for creating React elements). Here's a brief demo (from within this .mdx file) of how both can be used:

  Markdown: `*Italic text in Markdown. Default background.*` gives *Italic text in Markdown. Default background.*

  JSX:
  ```
  <div style={{fontStyle:'italic', backgroundColor:'orange'}}>
    <p>Italic text in JSX. Orange background.</p>
  </div>
  ```
  gives
  <div style={{fontStyle:'italic', backgroundColor:'orange'}}>
    <p>Italic text in JSX. Orange background.</p>
  </div>

- __Definitions/Jargon__: Another thing you might have noticed is that some words with a ***?*** aloft) have an attached definition that pops up when you hover over them, e.g. _tesseract_ and _Hypercubegraph_. This is done using a library called [*gatsby-remark-jargon*](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/tree/develop/packages/gatsby-remark-jargon).

- __Math__: MDX makes documents easily customisable. You can render mathematical text and symbols using [${\KaTeX}$](https://katex.org) — `$9 × 8$` becomes $9 × 8$, for example.

- __Embedddings__: I embed Wolfram Notebooks and other items from various sites such as Soundcloud and Vimeo using [`iframe`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).

## Aspirations
---

- [Automate](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/AutomatedReports.html) refreshing of meta notebook.
- Implement [images](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/using-gatsby-plugin-image) and Medium-like [zooming](https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom). Sometimes an image says it all.
- Make internal links in embedded notebooks open as a stacked page, and not as a new page in same/new browser tab.

For now I'll be updating its contents manually. Though in the future I might make it auto-update say, once every week, or whenever I add new note.
