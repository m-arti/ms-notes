title: Meta Note

## Inspiration
---

I discovered the idea of the _Digital Garden_ while roaming Maggie Appleton's [site](https://maggieappleton.com/metatour). This was around the end of summer 2020. I had just created my [blog](https://blog.martinssamuel.com/), and was looking for a way to add [Tuftesque](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) sidenotes to posts.

When I encountered the [idea](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), I was fascinated by it and knew straightaway that I'd later return to it. Further reading led me to Andy Matuschak's [site](https://andymatuschak.org/), and eventually to Aravind Balla's [notes](https://notes.aravindballa.com/). I'd been thinking of taking computable notes using [[wolfram-notebooks]] (WNs), and Aravind's layout seemed ideal for what I had in mind.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wolfram notebooks would make such a great computable notes app.</p>&mdash; @m_arti, <a href="https://twitter.com/m_arti/status/1225784947249754126">February 7, 2020</a>
</blockquote>

I like how plain and simple the layout is, and the seamless linking and transitions between notes. I also like that I can do my [[note-taking]] inside a WN and publish it straightaway. Notebooks are versatile and dynamic. A WN can take the form of a formal document or a computational essay. Cells can be hidden automatically and only revealed when hovered over. One can set a background of any colour. Youtube videos, Soundcloud tracks and Bing maps can be embedded.

It's possible to create a notebook-centric version of this theme. Pages will essentially be embedded notebooks. For WNs, docked cells can hold tags and other meta information on each note. The only potential issue I currently see with this is internal links, such as [this](/). There's a more dangerous potential issue—should Wolfram Cloud someday collapse, so shall the entire theme. WNs aren't currently so widely used as to be hosted by third-party organisations.

## How it works
---

- __Notes__:
  Notes are `.mdx` [files](https://github.com/m-arti/ms-notes/tree/master/content). [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) combines the strengths of Markdown and JSX (an extension of Javascript for creating React elements). I'll quickly demonstrate (from within this .mdx file) how both can be used.

  Markdown: `*Italic text in Markdown. Default background.*` gives *Italic text in Markdown. Default background.*

  JSX:
  ```
  <div style={{fontStyle:'italic', backgroundColor:'orange'}}>
    <p>Italic text in JSX. Orange background.</p>
  </div>
  ```
  gives
  <div style={{fontStyle:'italic', backgroundColor:'orange'}}>
    <p>Italic text in JSX. Orange background.</p>
  </div>

- __Embedddings__:
  I embed WNs and other items from various sites such Soundcloud and Vimeo using [`iframe`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).

- __Design / Style__:
  The original theme is [here](https://github.com/aravindballa/notes.aravindballa.com); [my version](https://github.com/m-arti/ms-notes) has some edits. This site uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)—speed, efficiency, simplicity. For 'dark mode', I use a a Tailwind CSS plugin called [Nightwind](https://nightwindcss.com). Nightwind greatly simplifies the handling colours and other settings which differ between light/dark modes. To match the style of embedded WNs to that of notes, I use a [stylesheet](https://github.com/m-arti/ms-notes/blob/master/src/style.wl). To stylise a notebook, I can  run the following from within that notebook:
 ```
 SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[],
 StyleDefinitions -> Import["https://wolfr.am/U7U6ZSd2"]]
 ```

## Why this way

## Aspirations
---

- [Automate](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/AutomatedReports.html) refreshing of meta notebook.
- Implement [images](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/using-gatsby-plugin-image) and Medium-like [zooming](https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom). Sometimes an image says it all.
- Make internal links in embedded notebooks open as a stacked page, and not as a new page in same/new browser tab.

For now I'll be updating its contents manually. Though in the future I might make it auto-update say, once every week, or whenever I add new note.
