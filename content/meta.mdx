title: Meta Note
---

## Inspiration
---
I discovered the idea of the _Digital Garden_ while roaming Maggie Appleton's [site](https://maggieappleton.com/metatour). This was around the end of summer 2020. I had just created my [blog](https://blog.martinssamuel.com/), and was looking for a way to add [Tuftesque](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) sidenotes to posts.

When I encountered the [idea](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), I was fascinated by it and knew straightaway that I'd later return to it. Further reading led me to Andy Matuschak's [site](https://andymatuschak.org/), and eventually to Aravind Balla's [notes](https://notes.aravindballa.com/). I'd been thinking of taking computable notes using [[wolfram-notebooks]], and Aravind's layout seemed ideal for what I had in mind.

I like how plain and simple the layout is, and the seamless linking and transitions between notes. I also like that I can do my [[note-taking]] inside a Wolfram Notebook and publish it straightaway. Notebooks are versatile and dynamic. A Wolfram Notebook can take the form of a formal document or a computational essay. Cells can be hidden automatically and only revealed when hovered over. One can set a background of any colour. Youtube videos, Soundcloud tracks and Bing maps can be embedded. It's possible to create a notebook-centric version of this theme. Pages will essentially be embedded notebooks. For Wolfram Notebooks, docked cells can hold tags and other meta information on each note. The only potential issue I currently see with this is internal links, such as [this](/).

That's right. A notebook which analyses the contents of _this_ notebook. For now I'll be updating its contents manually. Though in the future I might make it auto-update say, once every week, or whenever I add new note.
