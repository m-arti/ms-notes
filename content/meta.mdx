## Inspiration

I discovered the idea of the _Digital Garden_ while roaming Maggie Appleton's [site](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). This was around the end of summer 2020. I had just created my [blog](https://blog.martinssamuel.com/), and was looking for a way to add [Tuftesque](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) sidenotes to posts.

Further reading led me to Andy Matuschak's [site](https://andymatuschak.org/), which I believe is the origin of this theme, and eventually to Aravind Balla's [notes](https://notes.aravindballa.com/). I'd been thinking of taking computable notes using [[Wolfram Notebooks]], and Aravind's layout seemed ideal for what I had in mind. I like the idea of computational notebooks and I use them for [[note taking]]. With this medium, I'm exploring new ways of extending Wolfram Notebooks.

</blockquote>

I like how plain and simple the layout is, and the seamless linking and transitions between notes. I also like that I can do my note taking inside a Wolfram Notebook and publish it straightaway. Notebooks are versatile and [[dynamic]]. A Wolfram Notebook can take the form of a formal document or a computational essay. Cells can be hidden automatically and only revealed when hovered over. One can set a background of any colour. Youtube videos, Soundcloud tracks and Bing maps can be embedded. These are just a few things one can do with them on the web.

It's possible to create a notebook-centric version of this theme. Pages will essentially be embedded notebooks (Julia, Jupyter, Wolfram, etc.). For Wolfram Notebooks, docked cells can hold tags and other meta information on each note. There's a potentially more serious issue: should Wolfram Cloud—for instance, which hosts Wolfram Notebooks—someday collapse, so shall the entire theme. Wolfram Notebooks aren't currently so widely used as to be hosted by third-party organisations.

## How it works

- **Framework**: This site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), which claims to be *"the fastest frontend for the modern web."* It's hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). There is an [RSS feed](https://notes.martinssamuel.com/rss.xml) and a [sitemap](https://notes.martinssamuel.com/sitemap.xml).

- **Design/Style**:
  The original theme is [here](https://github.com/aravindballa/notes.aravindballa.com); [my version](https://github.com/m-arti/ms-notes) has some edits. Styling is done with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)—speed and simplicity.

  For *dark mode*, I use a Tailwind plugin called [Nightwind](https://nightwindcss.com). It simplifies the handling of colours that change when switching between light ⇄ dark modes. I give your device's dark mode setting precedence—changing it on your device will override that of this site. Click/tap this button to toggle: <span><button className="text-2xl align-middle" onClick={() => nightwind.toggle()}>◑</button></span>.

  Also, <span className="text-3xl align-bottom">⊞</span> shows a graph of all notes; credit to [Mathieu Dutour](https://git.io/JGmY0) for creating this very useful component. I use [use-sound](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/use-sound), to play an audio clip when the buttons are clicked.

  To match the style of embedded Wolfram Notebooks to that of notes, I use a [stylesheet](https://github.com/m-arti/ms-notes/blob/master/src/style.wl). The matching isn't quite exact—e.g., this site uses the font 'SF Pro', while notebooks use 'Source Sans Pro'. To stylise a notebook, I run the following from within that notebook:
 ```
 SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[],
 StyleDefinitions -> Import["https://wolfr.am/U7U6ZSd2"]]
 ```

- **Notes**:
  This thing you're currently reading is a *note*. Notes are `.mdx` files. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) combines the strengths of Markdown and JSX (an extension of Javascript for creating React elements). Here's a brief demo (from within this note) of how both can be used:

  — Markdown:<br/>
  `*Italic text in Markdown. Default background.*`<br/>
  *Italic text in Markdown. Default background.*

  — JSX:
  ```
  <div style={{fontStyle:'italic', backgroundColor:'orange'}}>
    <p>Italic text in JSX. Orange background.</p>
  </div>
  ```
  <div style={{fontStyle:'italic', backgroundColor:'orange'}}>
    <p>Italic text in JSX. Orange background.</p>
  </div>

  — JSX + Tailwind:
  ```
  <div class="italic text-white bg-indigo-500">
    <p>Italic text in JSX. Indigo background.</p>
  </div>
  ```
  <div class="italic text-white bg-indigo-500">
    <p>Italic text in JSX. Indigo background.</p>
  </div>

- **Definitions/Jargon**: You may have noticed that some words (with a ***?*** aloft) have an attached *definition* that pops up when you hover over them, e.g. _tesseract_ and _Hypercubegraph_. These are created using a Gatsby plugin rather appropriately called [*jargon*](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/tree/develop/packages/gatsby-remark-jargon).

- **Math**: MDX makes documents easily customisable. You can render mathematical text and symbols using [${\KaTeX}$](https://katex.org)—`$9 × 8$` becomes $9 × 8$, for example.

- **Embedddings**: I embed Wolfram Notebooks and other items from various sites such as Soundcloud and Vimeo using [`iframe`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).

## Why this way

- **Learning**: Life-long learning. The goal of this site is to learn from/about the things I write and through the process of doing so. Additionally, I'm learning some skills—web development/design, Javascript, etc.—through the process of adding features to the site and maintaining it.

- **Curation**: Of interlinked notes, ideas, knowledge, questions, etc. that I find interesting. But also of computational artefacts which evolve over time.

- **Simplicity**:
  At least, by way of presentation and interaction. Notes are intended to be short and simple. If a note matures into some lengthy disquisition, it ideally should be moved to my blog. There's quite a number of features here but each one has a purpose. I'd like to think that this is the least simple note you'll come across, as it demos all the features. Embeds, for instance, are one source of complexity, because the embedded object introduces its own interface, etc. However, within notes, I may need to link **[[dynamic]]** information. A basic example of this is today's date, [<img src="https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/mar/today" alt="Today's date generated by Wolfram Language code and deployed to the cloud" style="width:80px; display:inline; vertical-align:middle;"/>](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/mar/today). See further example below (date-time: when you opened this page;  overlay: yellow $=$ daytime, blue $=$ night-time), or write an equation, or define a term. The added features allow me to express ideas while keeping the notes simple and seamless.

  <center><div style={{width:'350px', height:'400px'}}>
    <iframe src="https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/mar/notes-meta-sky?_embed=iframe" width="100%" height="100%"></iframe>
  </div></center>

  I may experiment with rules in the future, e.g. a note musn't have more than $x$ links, $y$ definitions and $z$ embeds, perhaps excluding this meta note. I reckon I'll break them often.

## Aspirations

- [Automate](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/AutomatedReports.html) refreshing of meta notebook.
- Implement [images](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/using-gatsby-plugin-image) and Medium-like [zooming](https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom). Sometimes an image says it all.
- Make internal links in embedded notebooks open as a stacked page, and not as a new page in same/new browser tab.
- Create a Wolfram Notebook version of this theme like I described above.

## Meta notebook

This is a [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-arti/ms-notes/4ccb62f36641cd886207d3a35bc403f40a5cf7a7/images/wolfram-icon.svg" alt="Meta Wolfram Notebook on this site" style="width:20px; display:inline; vertical-align:middle; padding-right:2px"/>notebook](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/mar/Published/notes-meta.nb) which analyses the contents of site. For now I'll be updating its contents manually. Though in the future I might make it auto-update say, once every week, or whenever I add new note.
