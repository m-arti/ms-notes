- Psalms 52:8

- Psalms 84:1-4; 10
1 How lovely is your dwelling place, O LORD of hosts!
2 My soul longs, yes, faints for the courts of the LORD; my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God.

4 Blessed are those who dwell in your house, ever singing your praise! Selah
10 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness.

12 The righteous flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
13 They are planted in the house of the LORD; they flourish in the courts of our God.

15 to declare that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
