A couple of years ago I read E.F. Schumacher's [_Small is Beautiful_](https://www.worldcat.org/title/small-is-beautiful-economics-as-if-people-mattered/oclc/801273). It's one of the most enlightening books I've ever read and I'm returning to it now, because I've forgotten a lot of the information it contained. And it contained a lot of information, which I consider perspicacious of today's world, as I imagined it also would've been of the 1970's, when it was first published.

This is probably Schumacher's magnum opus. The full title of the book is _Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered_ and in it, Schumacher makes arguments for a more sensible, sustainable attitude towards consumption. He is asking us to rethink how we use resources, and to be mindful of the environmental impact of our habits.

If you'd like to hear a summary of the book and an insightful discussion of it, then I'd recommend the following episode of the Maxim Institute Podcast:

Instead of re-reading the book, I would like to do something different. I think that books such as this contain practical ideas and numerals, which one ought to explore beyond the book to truly understand, appreciate and apply. Thefore, I would like to explore the book — gather my annotations, run some of Schumacher's calculations and estimations, and so on. I'm not necessarily interested in critiquing the ideas in the book or commenting on philosophical and economical themes. Rather, I would like to better understand the ideas, especially from a historical perpective. It's about half a century since this book was first published, and I'm curious: is small (not) still beautiful?
